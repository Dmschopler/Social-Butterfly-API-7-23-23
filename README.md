# Social-Butterfly-API-7-23-23
## Description
This is an API for a social application like Meta or Myspace. Its functionality allows users to create a friend list, share their thoughts and react to thoughts from their friends. It is super simple compared to some of the larger, more used social networking applications but it was a good experience for me to understand how those applications may work. There is not too much actual data being used, but a NOSQL database is best for this type of application because it can handle a huge amount of unstructed data.
## Built With

- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose 

## Demo
Below is a quick video to show how the application works!
